# Zero-Downtime CI/CD Pipeline

## Executive Summary

This project delivers a production-grade, eight-stage CI/CD pipeline architecture for **NovaPay Digital Bank** — a fictional RBI-licensed bank transforming from manual SSH deployments to automated, compliant, zero-downtime continuous delivery. The pipeline addresses NovaPay's critical challenges: a 4.5-hour MTTR, fortnightly deployment cycles, zero automated compliance scanning, and 17 outstanding RBI audit non-conformances.

The architecture implements security-by-default through automated SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, container signing, and OPA/Kyverno policy gates — all mapped to RBI Master Direction on IT Risk and PCI-DSS v4.0 requirements. Blue-green and canary deployment strategies with statistical canary analysis ensure zero-downtime releases, while the expand-contract database migration pattern handles 100M+ row financial tables without maintenance windows. Automated rollback triggers across three severity categories guarantee sub-60-second recovery for critical failures.

The pipeline targets **DORA Elite performance**: multiple deployments per day, <1-hour lead time for changes, <5% change failure rate, and <1-hour MTTR — reducing commit-to-production time to under two hours while achieving five-nines availability.
